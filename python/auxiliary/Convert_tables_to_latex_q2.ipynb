In SP5 the authors mapped the critical files in the system and checked the dependencies of files before and after a refactoring and checked a decrease of  coupling among files.\n\ncontagius debt : is a kind of social debt that is mapped via document analysis and verification of Taxonomy of causes ATD proposed by Martini. It is necessary a specialist evaluation to indentify the ATD and measure it\n\ndecoupling level : is defined as a formula proposed by Kazman to define the level of decoupling of the component analysed\n\ndependency of componets : the authors defined a set of critical components in the system then establish a set of rules of dependency among components to check the level of dependences.\n\ncrisis point : is defined as amount of ATD Items accumulated that can break the software [Martini...]\n\n"
