The amount of architectural decisions impacted by the ATD item is 3. This way, Impact = 3 * 5 * (3*3) = 135. If our ATD repayment strategy would not affect other decisions, the Impact would be I = 3 * 1 * (1*3) = 9. From these results, software architect understand the impact of a repayment strategy.                                                                                                                                                                       | Evaluation research                                                                                          |
