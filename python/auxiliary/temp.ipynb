       " 67: 'technical debt management (tdm) has drawn the attention of software industries during the last years, including embedded systems. however, we currently lack an overview of how practitioners from this application domain perceive tech- nical debt. to this end, we conducted a multiple case study in the embedded systems industry, to investigate: (a) the expected life- time of components that have td, (b) the most frequently occur- ring types of td in them, and (c) the significance of td against run-time quality attributes. the case study was performed on seven embedded systems industries (telecommunications, print- ing, smart manufacturing, sensors, etc.) from five countries (greece, netherlands, sweden, austria, and finland). the results of the case study suggest that: (a) maintainability is more serious- ly considered when the expected lifetime of components is larger than ten years; (b) the most frequent types of debt are test, archi- tectural, and code debt; and (c) in embedded systems the run- time qualities are prioritized compared to design-time qualities that are usually associated with td. the obtained results can be useful for both researchers and practitioners: the former can focus their research on the most industrially-relevant aspects of td, whereas the latter can be informed about the most common types of td and how to focus their tdm processes.',\n",

       " 24: 'in this paper, we propose an architecture model called design rule space (drspace). we model the architecture of a software system as multiple overlapping drspaces, reflecting the fact that any complex software system must contain multiple aspects, features, patterns, etc. we show that this model provides new ways to analyze software quality. in particular, we introduce an architecture root detection algorithm that captures drspaces containing large numbers of a project’s bug-prone files, which are called architecture roots (archroots). after investigating archroots calculated from 15 open source projects, the following observations become clear: from 35% to 91% of a project’s most bug-prone files can be captured by just 5 archroots, meaning that bug-prone files are likely to be architecturally connected. furthermore, these archroots tend to live in the system for significant periods of time, serving as the major source of bug-proneness and high maintainability costs. moreover, each archroot reveals multiple architectural flaws that propagate bugs among files and this will incur high maintenance costs over time. the implication of our study is that the quality, in terms of bug-proneness, of a large, complex software project cannot be fundamentally improved without first fixing its architectural flaws.',\n",

       " 88: 'architectural technical debt can be generated by changes in the business and the environment of an organization. in this paper, we emphasize the change in scalability requirements due to new regulations. scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increased workload. for complex systems that are abruptly exposed via open interfaces and hence a greater workload, the scalability requirements may quickly increase, leading to technical debt. we term this scalability debt. this paper describes scalability triage, a light-weight, novel technique for identifying scalability threats as a form of technical debt. we illustrate this technique with an open banking case from a large software organization. open banking is partly caused by the new european psd2 regulative that enforce banks to open interfaces to unknown third-party actors. banking systems are well-established, mature systems. however, with the advent of open banking and psd2, the workload may quickly rocket. this leads to tougher scalability requirements and accumulated architectural debt, despite previously sound architectural decisions. using scalability triage, such risks may be identified fast. it will then be possible to prevent this form of technical debt with timely reengineering.',\n",
       " 90: 'large software systems tend to be highly complex and often contain unaddressed issues that evolve from bad design practices or architectural implementations that drift from definition. these design flaws can originate from quick fixes, hacks or shortcuts to a solution, hence they can be seen as technical debt. recently, new work has focused on studying source code comments that indicate technical debt, i.e., self-admitted technical debt (satd). however, it is not known if addressing information left by developers in the form source code comments can give insight about the design flaws in a system and have the potential to provide fixes for bad architectural implementations. this paper investigates the possibility of using satd comments to resolve architectural divergences. we leverage a data set of previously classified satd comments to trace them to the architectural divergences of a large open source system, namely argouml. we extract its conceptual and concrete architectures based on available design documentation and source code, and contrast both to expose divergences, trace them to satd comments, and investigate their resolution. we found 7 high-level divergences in argouml and 22 others among its subsystems, observing that merely 4 out of 29 (14%) divergences can be directly traced to satd. although using satd as an indicator of architectural divergences is viable, the effort of doing so is time-intensive, and in general, will not lend to a significant reduction of architectural flaws in a software system.',\n",

(rq2) how does the pagerank measure behave in the case a component is affected by different types of as simultaneously? to answer the above questions we analyze and compute in six open source java projects (ant, haddop, poi, tomcat, firebugs and juniti): • the architectural smells and their criticality (section 4.1); • the pagerank of the architectural smells (section 4.2); • the possible relations existing between architectural smell criticality and pagerank for rq1 (section 4.3.1.); • the pagerank of the components affected by multiple archi- tectural smells for rq2 (section 4.3.2)',\n",

       "irst exploration of using drspace to reveal the architectural impact on software quality, we proposed the concept of archroots—the drspaces that attract and prop- agate errors to multiple files, and their detection algorithm. our research is unique in that it explicitly ties software quality—in terms of bug-proneness—to the modular struc- ture of software architecture and architecture flaws. from the 15 projects that we selected, with varying sizes, domains, and ages, we observed that 1) an bug-prone design rule can make a large number of files within it drspace also error-prone; 2) the impacts of architecture connections among bug-prone files are significant and persistent over time. in each project, a substantial percentage of bug-prone files, with different bug-proneness levels and in different time-spans, are constantly concentrated in the top five arch- roots. our study also indicates that the impacts of archi- tecture connections among bug-prone files are persistent: there are long-lived architecture roots appearing in multiple releases of a project, connecting bug-prone files fixed in different time intervals. this suggests that, when fixing errors in a file, changes may propagate to other files that architecturally connect to it, and this impact can be persistent, lasting from months to years. the quantitative analysis of the architecture con- nections among bug-prone files shows that the architecture problems contained in the archroots are likely to be the root causes of bug-proneness. the take-away message of our study is this: to increase the quality and reduce the number of bugs within a software system, practitioners should pay attention to high-impact bug-prone design rules, as well as the architecture roots aggregating bug-prone files. our study also justified the value of further investigation of concrete architecture prob- lems: how they contribute to file bug-proneness, and their potential solutions, that is, the possible ways of refactoring.',\n",
       " 77: 'we conducted 17 interviews with software professionals from 10 companies and talked with them about the evolva- bility assurance for 14 different microservice-based systems. we found that systems developed for an external customer in a project-like manner generally relied more on central governance for the assurance. continuous product develop- ment of internal systems exhibited more decentralization and team autonomy for the assurance process. guidelines like architectural principles or rules for service communication were seen as important to provide a consistent basis for evolvability and to frame an otherwise diverse technology usage. while participants saw automation and tool support as important for evolvability assurance, they still relied a lot on manual activities like code review or boy scouting. tool and metric usage was very focused on source code quality. no architectural tools and metrics were applied, even though most reported challenges and issues like service cutting were related to software architecture. this may indicate the im- portance of architectural technical debt (atd) management for microservices. likewise, no tools or metrics specifically designed for service orientation were used, even though most participants stated the significance of their underlying design principles. participants generally perceived their fairly new microservices as decently evolvable, even though things like distributed code repositories and difficult macroarchitectural assessment would make the assurance process more complex. future work that covers the areas of maintenance, evolution, and technical debt in the context of microservices should take these findings and industry sentiments into account. in partic- ular, academia can support industry with methods, metrics, or tools that aid macroarchitectural assessment of microservices or provide a more system-centric view. we perceived tool support for service cutting activities and metrics to evaluate service granularity, coupling, or cohesion as concrete gaps that could save industry a lot of refactoring efforts. finally, issues in the area of human evolvability factors with microservices like the handling of hyped technologies as well as coordinating and exchanging knowledge between decentralized teams were described as important by participants.',\n",
       " 78: 'software code quality and technical debt have significant impact on a software product’s reliability and maintainability. this paper identifies a small, essential, set of static software code metrics linked to reliability and maintainability and to the most commonly identified sources of technical debt. a plug-in is created for the understand code visualization and static analysis tool that calculates and aggregates the metrics and produces a high-level interactive html report as well as developer-level information needed to address quality issues. a script makes use of git, understand, and the plug-in to compile results for lists of github repositories into a single file. while the plug-in is useful as-is, it was developed as a first step in an ongoing project aimed at applying case-based reasoning to the issue of software product quality. the next step in this project aims to use the described plug-in as part of a research effort to define and validate the aggregation of these metrics as part of a software quality model.',\n",
       " 81: 'business applications is formidable. for instance, even when applying the con- servative parameters in estimate 1, the average application is estimated to have $361,000 of td-principal for each 100 kloc. when the more realistic parameters of estimate 3 are applied, executives will likely dismiss the esti- mated size of td-principal as exces- sive. however, when large estimates result from accurate parameters for an organization’s hours to fix and cost per hour, then the percent of violations to be fixed can be varied to determine how many violations can be remediated within existing budgets and which vio- lations to prioritize. we urge caution in interpreting the estimates we present in this article as industry benchmarks. this explo- ration of estimates for td-principal demonstrates that these estimates are extremely sensitive both to the as- sumptions made in parameterizing the equation and the different types of languages to which they are applied. these estimates could also shift with changes in the mix of application char- acteristics in each language category as the number of applications grows in the appmarq repository. neverthe- less, these results provide a good start- ing point for exploring td-principal, and one that can be adjusted based on different assumptions about the pa- rameters used. when developed with professional discipline, estimates of td-principal can be a powerful tool to aid management in understanding and controlling it costs and risks.',\n",
       " 82: 'although td-principal can be measured as violations of good structural quality, these violations consist of different types of threats to the business or costs to it. in order to use td-principal effectively in making decisions about how much resource to allocate to eliminating these violations, management needs to distinguish among its quality priorities and then prioritize the importance of eliminating td- principal in each area. our data allow us to measure the td- principal associated with each of the five health factors since they represent different types of costs to it or risks to the business. the amount of td-principal in an application associated with each of these health factors differs. seventy percent of the td-principal measured in this sample was contained in the it cost related health factors of changeability (30%) and transferability (40%). thirty percent of the td- principal was associated with the business risk health factors of robustness (18%), security (7%), and performance efficiency (5%). we cannot determine from the data whether it organizations are spending more time eliminating td-principal related to business risk or whether td-principal is disproportionately created in it cost-related factors. nevertheless, a single high severity violation related to business risk can be devastating if it eventually causes an operational problem.',\n",
       " 85: 'since high-level principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, modularization, and hierarchy are quite generic, it is usually difficult to understand how to apply them in practice. to solve this problem, we can break down the fundamental principles to more granular “enabling techniques”, which helps us to understand the fundamental principles to a greater depth, but also ease the task of applying the principle in real-world situations. increasingly complex and demanding business environment evolves with integration strategy and architecture. the security architecture design and technology stakeholders chosen should facilitate user to deliver a modular approach to integration that supports new security requirements such as micro-services-based security development. the key solution should include open standards and open source software, both in provisos of technology and permit the model to distribute the profit of open source while extenuating, mitigating the risks. in this work an attempt is made to identify various architectural design debts causing factors in a present day computing system with special reference to mul- tilateral security architectural design. to overcome the architectural design, debt refactoring is the existing solution to repay the debt which also helps in reducing the vulnerabilities in the present day computing system.',\n",
       " 88: 'in this paper, we have studied architectural technical debt specifically related to scalability, which we call scalability debt. we presented a case related to open systems (open banking), where uncertainty causes scalability debt to be acquired continuously. we argue that, in such systems, a continuous and lightweight approach to manage scalability debt is required. we report a lightweight method used in an open banking organization to identify, estimate and prioritize scalability debt. such method consists of three phases, an initial triage to prioritize the areas with more likely impact due to scalability debt, a second phase where the debt is assessed in different affected subsystems and a third phase where the impact (interest) of the debt is calculated according to three scenarios. different thresholds and colors were used to document and communicate the scalability debt and its impact to stakeholders. a feature of the approach is the way it involved experts in the organization, starting with a few core experts, attracting more attention and more experts and key roles as the analysis grows and the risks are being identified. the results can be taken into consideration by practitioners when dealing with scalability debt and may be used as starting point to develop the method presented here further or to research novel lightweight approaches to manage technical debt related to other key business qualities.',\n",
       " 90: 'in this paper, we investigated the possibility of using satd comments to resolve architectural divergences. we leveraged a data set of classified satd comments and traced them to bad architectural implementations that we surfaced by contrasting the conceptual and concrete architectures of argouml, using its available design documentation and source code. our study revealed 29 architectural divergences, 7 in high-level layers, and 22 among subsystems. our preliminary results show that merely 4 out of 29 divergences (14%) can be directly traced to satd, and that looking at satd comments can provide enough information to fix them. to validate this, we manually implemented the changes as suggested by debt comments in each of the 4 traced divergences and confirmed that address- ing the comments directly leads to resolve the divergences. although satd can be used as an indicator for architectural divergences, it requires considerable time and effort, and will not result in a significant architectural improvement. to generalize our findings, we plan on replicating this study on a broader scale. looking at satd comments that can be traced to architectural divergences resulted effective in resolving them, thus, we plan to further investigate this with better architectural recovery and more advanced satd detection approaches, potentially in an automated manner.',\n",
       " 91: 'because there is little scientific research on the industry state of practice w.r.t. maintainability control in general and for sbss and μsbss specifically, we created a survey to find out about a) applied processes, tools, and metrics, b) satisfaction with this quality at- tribute, and c) potentially different treatment of systems based on service orientation. when analyzing the answers of 60 software professionals, we discovered that a combined 60% of our sample do not address maintainability at all or only implicitly at a very basic level. a combined 40% reported explicit handling, but only 10 participants reported using a systematic process. furthermore, 40% of participants were not satisfied with the state of maintain- ability of their software. 35% were somewhat satisfied and only 25% reported to be pleased with the maintainability of their system. lastly, ∼67% reported to not treat sbss and μsbss with special maintainability controls. ∼26% applied somewhat different controls and only ∼7% mentioned significantly different treatment. since the sample population is limited in size however, further research in this area is necessary to confirm similar distribution in other parts of the population, probably also exclusively with companies that specialize in the development of sbss and μsbss. regardless of the sample size though, some interesting points with potential impact for future research can be highlighted. first, there was extremely little reported usage of methods, tools, and met- rics that focused specifically on evolvability. while issues related to architecture-level evolvability were very present amongst the reported symptoms (e.g. architectural erosion or complexity or more time needed to add new functionality), very few participants reported actually addressing them. to avoid technical debt in a long-living software system, industry needs to improve their qual- ity control: they need to go beyond source code level metrics and also include an architecture-centric view on software evolution, potentially with scenario-based methods. a second take-away from this work is the suggested useful- ness of using a systematic process for maintainability control. while very few reported using such an approach, the vast major- ity of these 10 participants believed that this increased software quality and even wanted to invest more time for maintainability. people that used tools were also more likely to invest more time. to strengthen this, there was an overall correlation between the level of sophistication w.r.t. maintainability control and the reported sat- isfaction with this quality attribute: participants that used explicit and systematic approaches were more likely to be satisfied with the state of maintainability of their software. moreover, no direct link between a hindrance in productivity and the level of sophistication of applied actions could be found. lastly, the neglect of service-oriented particularities for quality control – especially on the metrics side – combined with the reported trust in the base level maintainability of service ori- entation could pose a threat for the quality of a long-living sbs. aspects like service granularity, service cohesion, or service cou- pling can easily become problematic when not tended to and can significantly hinder the maintenance and evolution of such a system. luckily, there was a correlation between treating service-oriented systems differently and the level of sophistication of applied ac- tions (on top of using tool support). so there is hope that with a rise in the general proficiency of maintainability control, under- standing for a different treatment of sbss and μsbss will grow as well. when looking specifically at the differences with treating mi- croservices however, there is an even wider gap. of the participants that reported different treatment, no one mentioned how poten- tial maintainability-related problems with increased technological heterogeneity, decentralization of control, or appropriate service granularity could be addressed. while these topics do not neces- sarily have to negatively impact maintainability, they still hold the potential to do so, if not executed with some care. since this is a rather young topic, qualitative interviews with experts in the field of microservices would most likely be a more effective approach.',\n",
       " 97: 'the main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the risk appetite concept into the architecture decision-making genre. this enabled the influence of the architects’ attitude towards risk on the architecture decision-making process to be classified and explored. although the results seem to be sound and logical, it would be valuable to perform a broader industry survey to provide further insights into how architects approach risks, including how they assess the risks, what kind of reward they expect, and how they valuate these. this would validate the results of this paper to a greater extent, or possibly provide additional insights into the matter.',\n",
       " 40: 'this paper reports on patterns in the process of architecting and ways in which the connected debt can be measured and managed. the patterns in question were observed in an industrial case study and found that they result in what is called social debt, i.e., a picture of the current state of things burdened by suboptimal sociotechnical decisions. in the case of the patterns reported in this paper, a considerable part of architectural decisions or the very process of archi- tecting in a certain way had a negative and (previously) invisible sociotechnical connotation. this paper also reports on a practice observed in the case study to mitigate some of the nasty consequences connected to emerging social debt. finally, the manuscript outlined dahlia, a sample metric for architectures to make (some) social debt explicit by measuring architectural (in)communicability, i.e., the likelihood that the developers’ network is (un)aware of architecture decisions. this paper contributions and discussions lead to the con- clusion that social debt and software architectures are tightly knit together and with technical debt as well and deserve further attention in the future. further studies are planned to elaborate on the findings, expanding the understanding of the relations between social debt, its technical counterpart, and software architectures possibly with an immersive study in industry. also, further studies are planned to understand the differences between social debt in closed-source industries (as reported in this paper) and open source, to possibly find successful architecting patterns elicited from open source, if any. in addition, several points highlighted in this paper remain open, for example: 1) what is the full mapping between software engineering economics concepts and the notion of social debt? 2) what is the role of interest repayment strategies as well as economic formulations around debt contraction and repayment as mapped to social debt? 3) what is the relation between effort-estimation techniques, the consequent organizational structure decisions, and the emergence of social debt? finally, further studies are being planned to elaborate further on the proposed metric for software architecture communi- cability, demonstrating its representation condition [12] and applying it in industrial practice in the operational form, with the goal of providing more solid and quantitative validation for it.'}"
