There is no calculation formula about cost of ATDnanThe data validation should be performed in a real industrial project.It was not shared the data collectionThe dataset was not available to reproduce the study.An external validity is that we only studied 21 open source projects, all of which were implemented in Java and all of which are from the Apache ecosystem. While we have no reason to assume that the effects that we have studied would be different with different programming languages, we can not currently claim that our results can be generalized to projects implemented using other languages. Similarly we have no expectation that our results would differ in closed- source contexts, or projects from other OSS ecosystems, but this remains a potential threat.The authors conducted a study using only C# OSS project, so it not possible to generalize to other types programing languages and private IT projects.The authors proposed an manual aprouch called AnaConDeb to identify ATDI and calculate the principal and Interest by stekholder for each release. So, it is possible that values changes depends on the company and the steakholdersDue to the study used only Open Source Software from Apache Project, it was not possible to calculate the effort to tix the ATD in terms of time or money. The calculation of cost proposed used the amount of lines necessary to fix the ATD.The practical idea of the study about ATDI approach hotspot identification in Android application is good.Weak. Actually, this is a technical paper with only two pages, and there is no scientific rigor.nanThere is no link to dataset of evaluationThe process is manual and it is necessary a participation of the architect to plan and evaluate each release. So, the principal and the interest are estimated manually according interpretation of specialist about ATDIThere is no repliaction kit to reproduce the studyThe authors proposed a manual method to calculate the effort to fix the ATD.nannanThe case study performed only one company in only one system.There is no identification of ATD itensThe authro used a tool that analysis only java source code. There is no method to calculate the ATD cost.There is not list of ATDI for each relase analysed in case study.Weak. The paper is more technical and describe a tool called DV8 and its importance to check the software architecture. However, it is not a scientific study.The study shoud be provide a repliaction kitThere is no repliaction kit to reproduce the studyThere is no data collected to compare the used tools. There is no Design research and there is no an experiment to evaluate the tools using a set of data.The dataset was not available to reproduce the study.The architectural debt index using architectural smells and tracking the index's evolution throughout a systemâ€™s history was not precise; for example, the authors should be created a formula to represent the architectural debt index. They were even using a demonstration of evaluation of each architectural smell individually, but a general formula was not created.The is no asses of effort waste to fix Architectural SmellnanThere is no data to proof the approuch. For example: maybe the authors shoud be use a real system to validate the proposal.Not applicableThere are no details about how to identify the TD, and there are no explicit future works.The is no ATDI issues explicited on the studyWeak, due to the author did not study about how to identify, measure or calculate ATDnannanThe study did not show details about identification, measure or calculate the cost of ATDI.The dataset used in study was not available to reproduce the resultsThe catalog of rules is private. So, only the CAST company can use this catalog. Besides, the value used to calculate the principal of TD is regarding to context of CAST company, thus, it not possible to generalize this value in other companies.The study did not share the dataset to evaluate. Besides, even calculating the TD cost, there is ATD specif costnanThe approuch to identify, estimate and calculate the scabality architectural issue is manual.The dataset was not available to reproduce the studyThe dataaset of survey should be shared in a .repository or replication kitBut the author did not work about architectural technical debt, only about behavior of software architect about risknan
