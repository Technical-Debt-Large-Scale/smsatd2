## Install dependecies

```bash
pip install -r python/requirements.txt
```

### Install [word cloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud.git)

A little word cloud generator in Python.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud.git
cd word_cloud && pip install .
```

Return to the main replication kit path (smsatd)
```bash
cd ..
```

### Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

## Executing scripts

```

Open scripts in python folder that you want to run

If you use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), you can simply open the Python script directly from Google Colab and install dependencies before running the selected Python script.

# Dataset

The dataset organize all studies used in this case. We created a spreadsheet to group the selected papers with all critical characteristics evaluated in this SMS.

The spreadsheet is available on [Extraction_form](https://github.com/armandossrecife/smsatd/blob/main/dataset/Extraction_form_basic2022.xlsx)

# Systematic Mapping Process

The main activities of this SMS follow five main phases: 

 - Define research questions 
 - Search process 
 - Selection process 
 - Extraction process 
 - Analysis process
