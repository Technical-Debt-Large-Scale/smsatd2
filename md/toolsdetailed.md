Regardless of what languages or CI/CDs you use, we can process your code coverage uploads against your entire project. Codecov just works out of the box. Get a summary of coverage information directly in your workflow so that you can add and update tests quickly and effectively. Block underperforming pull requests from being merged with status checks. No more indecision if a code change has enough test coverage. Use badges.                                                                                                                                                     |

In fact, simian can be used on any human readable files such as ini files, deployment descriptors, you name it. Especially on large enterprise projects, it can be difficult for any one developer to keep track of all the features (classes, methods, etc.) of the system. Simian can be used as part of the build process during development or as a guide when re-factoring.

Classes are represented by objects which contain all the symbolic information of the given class: methods, fields and byte code instructions, in particular. Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a program (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and written to a file again. An even more interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch at run-time. The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful if you want to learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class files. |

Static code analyzer that allows you to monitor a software system for technical quality and enforce rules regarding software architecture, metrics and other aspects in all stages of the development process. The Sonargraph platform supports Java, C#, Python 3 and C/C++ out of the box and includes powerful features like a Groovy based scripting engine and a DSL (domain specific language) to describe software architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Measure your system using state-of-the-art architecture metrics suite: Decoupling Level (DL) and Propagation Cost (PC). Monitor the degradation, variation, and evolution of software projects. Compare and contrast with an industrial benchmark. Detect design flaws responsible for ever-increasing maintenance costs. Visualize which files are involved in which flaws. Diagnose flaws to improve your architecture. Calculate the maintenance costs incurred by each design flaw. Estimate the penalty caused by design debts. Estimate Return-on-Investment (ROI) of refactoring                                                                                                                                     |
