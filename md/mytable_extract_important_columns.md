The amount of architectural decisions impacted by the ATD item is 3. This way, Impact = 3 * 5 * (3*3) = 135. If our ATD repayment strategy would not affect other decisions, the Impact would be I = 3 * 1 * (1*3) = 9. From these results, software architect understand the impact of a repayment strategy.                                                                                                                                                                       | Evaluation research                                                                                          | Case study, expert opinion, observation                                       | In this research we faced several challenges that became evident in the case study. First, much of the software architec- ture decisions were not fully documented. Client does not pay for documentation. Rationale of decisions is divided among several artifacts. In this case study we found that Slack was used to justify some decisions. Also, we found that several diagrams were made using PowerPoint. Another challenge we faced was the recovery process of these sources. One of the authors is part of the project so it was easy to have access to this information, but other projects couldn’t have its information so accessible. Also, more complex projects will require more artifacts to analyze and this will include different storing structures.                                                                                                                                      | Future work will include convolutional neural networks to train a model to understand diagrams made in PowerPoint or another tool and saved as an image, such as IMEAV [19]. We also plan to include a recommendation system to suggests repayment strategies under certain conditions. Different meta- models for storing ATD should be reviewed.

This could allow developers/maintainers to make a business case (costs vs benefits) and help them to set the order in which they want to remove the AS. Towards the definition of this index oriented to the evaluation of the cost-solving, we are also interested to work on the development of some kind of automatic/semiautomatic refactoring support by studying the different refactoring opportunities of each AS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Consequently, the conclusion drawn is only valid for C# projects. There is a need of conducting more studies for the projects written in other object-oriented languages, such as Java.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Based on the results and findings of this work, we plan to do further research in the following directions. First, we intend to validate the correlation between modularity metrics and ANMCC with Java projects. Second, it will be interesting to define new system-wide modularity metrics or adapt existing modularity metrics defined in other perspectives (e.g., complex networks [14]), and investigate the correlation between the metrics and ATD indicators. We expect that the new modularity metrics can improve the accuracy or take less effort of predicting ANMCC. Third, it is practically valuable to develop plugins to calculate the modularity metrics IPCI and IPGF for IDE tools (e.g., in VS2012 or Eclipse).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Most of the effort measures used for calculating the different components are based on the experiences of the experts involved. This might have injected some bias in the study. However, the overall framework and the components that can be used to estimate ATD refactoring are quite generalizable, the indicators have been considered as useful and the decision making process proper. The different metrics that can be used as input needs to be further studied, however they usually depend on the different company. Another limitation is the learning curve: it took a while before the architects would employ the method, but after the sessions, they recognized that the method was very logical and that the process would probably be much shorter as the method was repeated and the tasks of collecting information split among the architects. | Future work aims at increasing the precision of these estimations with more precise measures. We have to keep in mind that ATD management is prevalently a risk assessment practice, and until better prediction models have been created to predict the cost of architecture anti-patterns (as confirmed in a recent systematic review [8]), the architects’ decisions are based on gut feeling and estimations based on their subjective experiences [20]. However, structuring such process of decision making by applying the method AnaConDebt, has been proven useful in order to make the decision around ATD refactoring based to concrete factors that are causing the interest to be paid in the future, and therefore it would explicit and increase the architects’ knowledge for making informed decision on the ATD refactoring cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Second, our approach has the limitation that it relies on revision history to iden- tify architectural debt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | We plan to evaluate the eficiectiveness of our approach on projects without enough history in our future work. In our future work, we plan to explore more effort proxies, and we are collaborating with an industry project that records actual effort data, and we plan to compare this with our proxy measures of effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Therefore the steepness of the curves and the projections might vary in real context. The magnitude for the contribution of each factor is also to be further assessed. However, we offer the recognition of factors that are not necessarily possible to be measured and therefore discovered by quantitative analysis, such as urgency and uncertainty. The results are qualitatively developed through a thorough research process and using a wide amount of qualitative data coming from more than 30 informants from 7 sites and with different roles, which allowed as to compare and test statements among themselves. Furthermore, architecture documentation has been evaluated as well as secondary data. This has allowed us to apply source triangulation.                                       | Some open issues that require further investigation are:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

That is, we plan to analyze periodic snapshots of SoftServe’s system, to see whether the refactoring is being done correctly, and whether it is eroding over time. Second, we plan to continue to track the frequency of reported defects, and their connection to the files in SS1. Third we plan to continue to track the frequency of changes to the files of SS1. Finally, we plan to track the lines of code committed to fix defects and to make changes. This longitudinal data capture and analysis will allow us to validate the expectations and opinions collected in the present study, and to build better predictive models for SoftServe in the future. We are also in the process of conducting other industrial case studies, to show the repeatability of our methods in different industrial contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

However, we aimed at reporting the understanding from a case study, which included both qualitative and quantitative data, rather than surveying a large number of practitioners. Furthermore, as previously explained, we offer a novel understanding of an important and overlooked research subject. The authors aim at collecting such evidence, using an investigation tool improved with the help of the exploratory results obtained from the study presented here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The next step, already in the authors’ plan, consists of conducting a version of this investigation involving a large sample of respondents from a large set of companies, in order to further strengthen the current case study-specific findings with a broad, quantitative investigation. Another important next step is to analyze the customer-related information used during the prioritization activity in order to understand how they are compared to the ATD effects in order to prioritize ATD refactoring against feature development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

We also plan to investigate the reasoning behind the architectural violations, whatever they are intentional or not, and whatever or which the architectural violations benefit the final product. Finally, stakeholders that were part of the early evaluation of the tool said that it would be valuable to see the evolution of the debt.

We would like also to work on the definition of a new TDI, with a focus on code and architectural debt, and experiment it on a large dataset of projects. In the TDI computation we would like to consider: 1) Code and Architectural smells detection; 2) Code and architecture/design metrics; 3) History of a system, including code changes and lifespan of smells; 4) Identification of problems more critical than others, to weight the collected analysis elements (e.g., metrics, smells, issues) according to their relevance in existing (past) projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

We examine only two systems, albeit with very different designs and from two different firms. We cannot be sure that the findings would apply to other firms or sys- tems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Our study generates a number of avenues for future work. First, it provides a benchmark for future studies that seek to examine the relationship between measures of architecture and the costs associated with maintenance and adaptation. Second, it provides methods for evaluating the technical debt associated with software architecture, which could be verified via future empirical studies across a larger number of contexts and systems. Finally, while we focus only on the costs associated with corrective maintenance, a significant amount of the value from refactoring is likely to come from an increase in developer productivity when responding to new requirements.

Such design decisions are mainly: (a) architecture components, including their interfaces, such as the kernel, shells, and libraries; (b) architecture connectors such as pipes and C header files; (c) architecture patterns [71] that were applied in the system, such as layering and reflection; and (d) the princi- ples that guide the system architecture, such as modularity and separation of concerns.

Consequently, without an investment on processes and tools to track TD, it remains difficult to make TD visible. And it is difficult to advocate for refactoring invisible TD. This represents a vicious cycle: companies suffer the negative effects of TD and try to contain it, but at the same time they do not find enough motivations to invest in a more systematic management process. By looking at the motivations for start tracking TD, the results show that organizations do so when they experience the interest of TD: slow feature development, quality issues and performance degradation. However, at such point the interest of the TD is already high and, as explained in our recent papers [6], [10], it is hard to refactor, as the cost has also increased and become too expensive. In conclusion, the only way out the vicious cycle seems to be, for the practitioners, to proactively start tracking TD. However, we do not have evidence yet that such improvement would bring the 25% effort down. This is a long-term study that should be set for future research to conduct |

In particular, academia can support industry with methods, metrics, or tools that aid macroarchitectural assessment of Microservices or provide a more system-centric view. We perceived tool support for service cutting activities and metrics to evaluate service granularity, coupling, or cohesion as concrete gaps that could save industry a lot of refactoring efforts. Finally, issues in the area of human evolvability factors with Microservices like the handling of hyped technologies as well as coordinating and exchanging knowledge between decentralized teams were                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

So, only the CAST company can use this catalog. Besides, the value used to calculate the principal of TD is regarding to context of CAST company, thus, it not possible to generalize this value in other companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The next step in our exploration of TD-principal is to provide individual ratings for the effort to fix each of the 1,200+ violations. These effort ratings will be further adjusted by the number of components involved in fixing the violation and the complexity of each component. This refinement will make the calculation of TD-principal more granular and could provide better in- dicators of components most in need of refactoring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
