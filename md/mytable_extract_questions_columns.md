The amount of architectural decisions impacted by the ATD item is 3. This way, Impact = 3 * 5 * (3*3) = 135. If our ATD repayment strategy would not affect other decisions, the Impact would be I = 3 * 1 * (1*3) = 9. From these results, software architect understand the impact of a repayment strategy.                                                                                                                                                                       | Evaluation research                                                                                          |

Such design decisions are mainly: (a) architecture components, including their interfaces, such as the kernel, shells, and libraries; (b) architecture connectors such as pipes and C header files; (c) architecture patterns [71] that were applied in the system, such as layering and reflection; and (d) the princi- ples that guide the system architecture, such as modularity and separation of concerns. A quantitative point of view. Specifically we look at how metrics of size and complexity evolve over time; these metrics concern system features (e.g. number of user commands or system calls), as determined by the Unix reference documentation | Yes, after each release using a proprietary method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | general: # appouch: analysis of unix documentation, analysis of repository of unix history, souce code analysis, measure complexity, calculate cyclomatic complexity, component level, Constant Comparison, Another major force that has been driving the software architecture is portability# tools:                            | No                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Validation Research                                                                                          |
