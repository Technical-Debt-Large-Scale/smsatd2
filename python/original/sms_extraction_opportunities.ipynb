Consequently, without an investment on processes and tools to track TD, it remains difficult to make TD visible. And it is difficult to advocate for refactoring invisible TD. This represents a vicious cycle: companies suffer the negative effects of TD and try to contain it, but at the same time they do not find enough motivations to invest in a more systematic management process. By looking at the motivations for start tracking TD, the results show that organizations do so when they experience the interest of TD: slow feature development, quality issues and performance degradation. However, at such point the interest of the TD is already high and, as explained in our recent papers [6], [10], it is hard to refactor, as the cost has also increased and become too expensive. In conclusion, the only way out the vicious cycle seems to be, for the practitioners, to proactively start tracking TD. However, we do not have evidence yet that such improvement would bring the 25% effort down. This is a long-term study that should be set for future research to conduct',\n",
