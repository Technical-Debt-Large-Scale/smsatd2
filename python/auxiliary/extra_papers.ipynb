In this study, we aim at developing a better understanding of how software development organizations conceptualize architectural debt, and how they deal with it. In order to do so, in this investigation we apply a mixed empirical method, constituted by a grounded theory study followed by focus groups. With the grounded theory method we construct a theory on architectural technical debt by eliciting qualitative data from software architects and senior technical staff from a wide range of heterogeneous software development organizations. We applied the focus group method to evaluate the emerging theory and refine it according to the new data collected. The result of the study, i.e., a theory emerging from the gathered data, constitutes an encompassing conceptual model of architectural technical debt, identifying and relating concepts such as its symptoms, causes, consequences, management strategies, and communication problems. From the conducted focus groups, we assessed that the theory adheres to the four evaluation criteria of classic grounded theory, i.e., the theory fits its underlying data, is able to work, has relevance, and is modifiable as new data appears. By grounding the findings in empirical evidence, the theory provides researchers and practitioners with novel knowledge on the crucial factors of architectural technical debt experienced in industrial contexts.\"\n",

Project Managers tend to delay paying off this debt because they face difficulties in comparing the cost of the refactoring against the benefits gained. These managers need to estimate the cost and the efforts required to conduct these refactoring activities as well as to decide which flaws have higher priority to be refactored.Our research is based on a dataset used by other researchers that study the technical debt. It includes more than 18,000 refactoring operations performed on 33 apache java projects. We applied the COCOMO II:2000 model to calculate the refactoring cost in person-months units per release. Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between the refactoring efforts and two static code metrics of the refactored code. The research revealed a weak correlation between the refactoring efforts and the size of the project, and a moderate correlation with the code complexity. Finally, we applied the DesigniteJava tool to verify our research results. From the analysis we found a significant correlation between the ranking of the architecture smells and the ranking of refactoring efforts for each package. Using machine learning practices, we took the architecture smells level and the code metrics of each release as an input to predict the levels of the refactoring effort of the next release. We calculated the results using our model and found that we can predict the ‘High’ and ‘Very High’ levels, the most significant levels from managers’ perspective, with 93 accuracy.\"\n",

This concept is transversal to all sciences, especially in experimental physics and systems. However, technical debt is difficult to manage because there is a lack of time, expertise, or knowledge on how to perform it. This paper proposes a computational model of technical debt management in software architecture, based on observations made in software teams in their daily work. This computational model exploits natural language processing and model-testing techniques on software project artifacts to build a model that allows localizing and visualizing the impact produced by the technical debt and its payment strategies. This proposal aims to support teams of architects to explain the current and future impact of the debt injected as a result of decisions made.\"\n",

Therefore, TD prioritization is essential to best allocate such resources to determine which TD items are to be repaid first and which items are to be delayed until later releases. This study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify and analyze the currently researched TD prioritization approaches. The employed search strategy strove to achieve high completeness through the identification of a quasi-gold standard set, which was used to establish a search string to automatically retrieve papers from select research databases. The application of selection criteria, along with forward and backward snowballing, identified 24 TD prioritization approaches. The analysis of the identified approaches revealed a scarcity of approaches that account for cost, value, and resources constraint and a lack of industry evaluation. Furthermore, this SLR unveils potential gaps in the current TD prioritization research, which future research may explore.\"\n",

This can be attributed to various reasons such as heavy work-load, tight delivery schedule, unawareness of good practices, etc. To shed light into the context that leads to technical debt accumulation, in this paper we investigate: (a) the temporality of code technical debt introduction in new methods, i.e., whether the introduction of technical debt is stable across the lifespan of the project, or if its evolution presents spikes; and (b) the relation of technical debt introduction and the development team’s workload in a given period. To answer these questions, we perform a case study on twenty-seven Apache projects, and inspect the number of Technical Debt Items introduced in 6-month sliding temporal windows. The results of the study suggest that: (a) overall, the number of Technical Debt Items introduced through new code is a stable metric, although it presents some spikes; and (b) the number of commits performed is not strongly correlated to the number of introduced Technical Debt Items.\"\n",

Agile methodologies, in particular Scrum, are widely used by development teams around the world. Estimation is an often practised step in sprint planning. The subject matter of this paper is the impact technical debt has on estimations. Objective: The goal of this research is to identify estimation problems and their solutions due to previously introduced technical debt in software projects. Method: The Systematic mapping study (SMS) method was applied in the research. Papers were selected from the popular digital databases (IEEE, ACM, Scopus, etc.) using defined search criteria. Afterwards, a snowballing procedure was performed and the final publication set was filtered using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: 42 studies were selected and evaluated. Five categories of problems and seven proposed solutions to the problems have been extracted from the papers. Problems include items related to business perspective (delivery pressure or lack of technical debt understanding by business decision-makers) and technical perspective (difficulties in forecasting architectural technical debt impact or limits of source code analysis). Solutions were categorized in: more sophisticated decision-making tools for business managers, better tools for estimation support and technical debt management tools on an architectural-level, portfolio approach to technical debt, code audit and technical debt reduction routine conducted every sprint. Conclusion: The results of this mapping study can help taking the appropriate approach in technical debt mitigation in organizations. However, the outcome of the conducted research shows that the problem of measuring technical debt impact on estimations has not yet been solved. We propose several directions for further investigation. In particular, we would focus on more sophisticated decision-making tools.\"\n",

To accomplish this task, we used a survey research method to collect and analyze a corpus of 28 software architects from Colombia, as a part of the InsighTD project. Results showed that inappropriate planning is the most cited technical debt cause by software architects. However, results differ when comparison against engineers and manager are performed. Innacurate time estimate and producing more without quality were the most selected causes of technical debt according to engineers and managers. To improve this comparison, the rank-biased overlapping technique was used. As more elements were compared, more similar were these lists of causes among all three roles.\"\n",

The goal of this study is to investigate the existing body of knowledge in software engineering to understand what Technical Debt prioritization approaches have been proposed in research and industry. Method. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review of 557 unique papers published until 2019, following a consolidated methodology applied in software engineering. We included 44 primary studies. Results. Different approaches have been proposed for Technical Debt prioritization, all having different goals and proposing optimization regarding different criteria. The proposed measures capture only a small part of the plethora of factors used to prioritize Technical Debt qualitatively in practice. We present an impact map of such factors. However, there is a lack of empirical and validated set of tools. Conclusion. We observed that Technical Debt prioritization research is preliminary and there is no consensus on what the important factors are and how to measure them. Consequently, we cannot consider current research conclusive. In this paper, we therefore outline different directions for necessary future investigations.\"\n",

In this paper, we will study five open-source software projects (OSSPs) that have several releases and also estimate the numbers of architecture smells (ASs), design smells (DSs), and code smells (CSs) for every release. Designite will be used to detect smells. We describe a case study conducted to explore the following: (1) What is the average smells density for architecture, design, and code smells in an OSSP? (2) Does the density of each smell type increase over multiple releases? (3) What percentage of each smell-type density is eliminated by refactoring? We collected around 2 million LOC from five OSSPs that have multiple releases from the GitHub repository to statistically analyze the software concerning the smells as indicators of TD. We find 36% of Architecture Technical Debt (ATD) is Cyclic Dependency, while 33% of Design Debt (DD) is Cyclically-dependent Modularization. More than 70% of Code Debt (CD) is Magic Number. Even though the developers do refactoring between releases, the TD density in general increases.

    "abstract20 = \"Background: A consistent body of research and practice have identified that technical debt provides valuable and actionable insight into the design and implementation deficiencies of complex software systems. Existing software tools enable characterizing and measuring the amount of technical debt at selective granularity levels; by providing a computational model, they enable stakeholders to measure and ultimately control this phenomenon. Aims: In this paper we aim to study the evolution and characteristics of technical debt in open-source software. For this, we carry out a longitudinal study that covers the entire development history of several complex applications. The goal is to improve our understanding of how the amount and composition of technical debt changes in evolving software. We also study how new technical debt is introduced in software, as well as identify how developers handle its accumulation over the long term. Method: We carried out our evaluation using three complex, open-source Java applications. All 110 released versions, covering more than 10 years of development history for each application were analyzed using SonarQube. We studied how the amount, composition and history of technical debt changed during development, compared our results across the studied applications and present our most important findings. Results: For each application, we identified key versions during which large amounts of technical debt were added, removed or both. This had significantly more impact when compared to the lines of code or class count increases that generally occurred during development. However, within each version, we found high correlation between file lines of code and technical debt. We observed that the Pareto principle was satisfied for the studied applications, as 20% of issue types generated around 80% of total technical debt. Interestingly, there was a large degree of overlap between the issues that generated most of the debt across the studied applications. Conclusions: Early application versions showed greater fluctuation in the amount of existing technical debt. We found application size to be an unreliable predictor for the quantity of technical debt. Most debt was introduced in applications as part of milestone releases that expanded their feature set; likewise, we identified releases where extensive refactoring significantly reduced the level of debt. We also discovered that technical debt issues persist for a long time in source code, and their removal did not appear to be prioritized according to type or severity.\"\n",

It is designed to run as a large-scale study based on continuous and independent replications in different countries. The survey instrument asks practitioners to describe in detail a real example of TD from their experience. We present in this paper the design of InsighTD, which has the primary goal of replication at a large-scale, with the results of the study in Brazil as a small part of the larger puzzle. ResultsThe first iteration of the InsighTD survey, carried out in Brazil, yielded 107 responses. We identified a total of 78 causes and 66 effects, which confirm and also extend the current knowledge on causes and effects of TD. Then, we organized the identified set of causes and effects in probabilistic cause-effect diagrams. The proposed diagrams highlight the causes that can most contribute to the occurrence of TD as well as the most common effects that occur as a result of debt.

Although in economics the two terms are related, in TD there is no study on this direction so as to validate the strength of the metaphor. Objective We study the relation between Principal and Interest, and subsequently dig further into the ‘ingredients’ of each concept (since they are multi-faceted). In particular, we investigate if artifacts with similar levels of TD Principal exhibit a similar amount of TD Interest, and vice-versa. Method To achieve this goal, we performed an empirical study, analyzing the dataset using the Mantel test. Through the Mantel test, we examined the relation between TD Principal and Interest, and identified aspects that are able to denote proximity of artifacts, with respect to TD. Next, through Linear Mixed Effects (LME) modelling we studied the generalizability of the results. Results The results of the study suggest that TD Principal and Interest are related, in the sense that classes with similar levels of TD Principal tend to have similar levels of Interest. Additionally, we have reached the conclusion that aggregated measures of TD Principal or Interest are more capable of identifying proximate artifacts, compared to isolated metrics. Finally, we have provided empirical evidence on the fact that improving certain quality properties (e.g., size and coupling) should be prioritized while ranking refactoring opportunities in the sense that high values of these properties are in most of the cases related to artifacts with higher levels of TD Principal. Conclusions The findings shed light on the relations between the two concepts, and can be useful for both researchers and practitioners: the former can get a deeper understanding of the concepts,whereas the latter can use our findings to guide their TD management processes such as prioritization and repayment.\"\n",

In this paper is presented the application of the Normative Process Framework to make technical debt visible with a large system developed by students of software engineering. The Normative Process Framework is used in conjunction with a process to find technical debt and document it in a simple format. Results show how technical debt was made visible for that system in a simplified way, by using documentation generated during development, and considering not only code, but also other software assets. Once technical debt is made visible is easier to evaluate and prioritize it, to establish a convenient set of actions to control it.\"\n",

They are the result of design decisions which negatively impact on software quality, and may lead to what is called Architectural Technical Debt. When such problems arise, developers feel difficulties in maintaining and evolving their architectures. Some tools have been developed to automatically identify architectural smells and in this study we propose the evaluation of architecture erosion in an industrial context through Arcan, an analysis tool able to identify eight architectural smells. In particular, we report the results of an industrial case study born from the collaboration between a Laboratory of the University of Milano-Bicocca and an italian company active in the software consulting field. The study has been structured as a survey on the architectural smells detected by the tool, from which we collected the feedback and opinions of the three projects’ developers. Developers learned about architectural smells and became aware of the fact that their project had additional problems with respect to what they knew.

These trade-offs lead to a higher system maintenance cost, and it is difficult to often enhance the application. In some cases, enhancements can result in the entire modules being rewritten. So, in order to reduce the debt from the system, it is required to identify the debt and the project cycle where most of the debts occur. To automatically address this problem, this work uses the machine learning and text analytics model. Random forest and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms extract features from incident tracker documents and effectively classify the technical debts. The proposed technical debt classification model is made sustainable to handle the growing volumes of project documents by executing a distributed framework. The performance of both the models is examined, and it is found that SVM outperforms the other.\"\n",

Sometimes developers need to implement quick changes to meet deadlines rather than a better solution that would take longer. These easy choices, known as Technical Debts, can cause long-term negative impacts because they can bring extra effort to the team in the future. One way to detect technical debts is through source code comments. Developers often insert comments in which they admit that there is a need to improve that part of the code later. This is known as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). Objective: Evaluate a Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model to identify design and requirement SATDs from comments in source code. Method: We performed a controlled experiment to evaluate the quality of the model compared with two language models from literature in a labeled dataset. Results: Our model results outperformed the other models in precision, improving average precision in approximately 8% compared to auto-sklearn and 19% compared to maximum entropy approach, however, the LSTM model achieved worse results in recall and f-measure. Conclusion: We found that the LSTM model can classify with better precision but needs a larger training, so it can improve on the detection of negative cases.\"\n",

Something that is inherent to software maintenance is technical debt, many ﬁnd this an intangible concept which is diﬃcult to manage. Technical debt can accumulate quickly when neglected, which has a deterrent eﬀect on productivity, making it even harder to reduce the debt in the ﬁrst place. In this research we propose a method which enables managers to make strategic resource allocation decisions, to keep software at an optimum debt level. We started by conducting a systematic literature review into the concepts of software maintenance, technical debt and productivity. We found theoretical evidence that TD can be manipulated by adjusting the software maintenance eﬀort allocation. Literature suggested that by reducing technical debt, the productivity of developers could improve. Based on this literature review, we constructed a process-model which incorporates all the components necessary to manage technical debt by allocating resources. We deﬁned measures for each component that are not software speciﬁc so the method can be easily implemented in multiple diﬀerent projects and organizations. Thereafter we created an artifact which is build on this processmodel with the goal of constructing a tool which can be used in practice. We thoroughly documented the design part of this artifact, explaining the design choices made by the researcher. In the ﬁnal stage of this research, we build the actual algorithm and implemented it in a medium size IT company. While only being a proof of concept version, the preliminary results are very promising. The evidence suggest that technical debt management strategies can have a large inﬂuence on average productivity when considering longer horizons. This means our method can save costs, time and improve productivity with the same amount of eﬀort.\"\n",

Typically, these features are not removed because of various reasons, e.g., because removing them might be considered too costly, the costs of keeping unused features is considered low, or because of the 'sunk cost fallacy', i.e., that a feature is considered worth to keep because of the previously invested resources (time, money or effort) to build it.

We interviewed practitioners from four large international companies involved in microservices projects to identify problems when using shared libraries. Our results show that the participating companies had issues with shared libraries as follows: coupling among teams, delays on fixes due to overhead on libraries development teams, and need to maintain many versions of the libraries. Our results highlight that the use of shared libraries may hinder agility on microservices. Thus, their use should be restricted to situations where shared libraries cannot be replaced by a microservice and the costs of replicating the code on each service is very high.\"\n",

The study is designed using an exploratory multiple-case case study following well-know guidelines and using fourteen open source Java projects. Three different research questions are identified and investigated through statistical analysis. Co-changes are detected by using both a state-of-the-art algorithm and a novel approach. The three architectural smells selected are among the most important from the literature and are detected using open source tools. The results show that 50% of co-changes eventually end up taking part in an architectural smell. Moreover, statistical tests indicate that in 50% of the projects, files and packages taking part in smells are more likely to co-change than non-smelly files. Finally, co-changes were also found to appear before smells 90% of the times a smell and a co-change appear in the same file pair. Our findings show that Reliability is indirectly affected by low levels of Maintainability even at the architectural level.

To fulfill this, in this paper, we unify the knowledge about the detection of architectural smells through a systematic mapping study. We report on the existing detection techniques and tools for architectural smells to identify their limitations. We find there has been limited investigation of some architectural smells (e.g., micro-service smells); many architectural smells are not detected by tools yet; and there are limited empirical validations of techniques and tools. Based on our findings, we suggest several open research problems, including the need to (1) investigate undetected architectural smells (e.g., Java package smells), (2) improve the coverage of architectural smell detection across architecture styles (e.g., service-oriented and cloud), and (3) perform empirical validations of techniques and tools in industry across different languages and project domains.\"\n",

According to this principle, software should be organized into modules that are tightly linked internally (high cohesion), whereas at the same time as independent from other modules as possible (low coupling). However, in practice, this principle is violated due to poor architecting design decisions, lack of time, or coding shortcuts, leading to a phenomenon termed as architectural technical debt (ATD). To alleviate this problem (lack of architectural modularity), the most common solution is the application of a software refactoring, namely Move Class—i.e., moving classes (the core artifact in object-oriented systems) from one module to another. To identify Move Class refactoring opportunities, we employ a search-based optimization process, relying on optimization metrics, through which optimal moves are derived. Given the extensive search space required for applying a brute-force search strategy, in this paper, we propose the use of a genetic algorithm that re-arranges existing software classes into existing or new modules (software packages in Java, or folders in C++). To validate the usefulness of the proposed refactorings, we performed an industrial case study on three projects (from the Aviation, Healthcare, and Manufacturing application domains). The results of the study indicate that the proposed architecture reconstruction is able to improve modularity, improving both coupling and cohesion. The obtained results can be useful to practitioners through an open source tool; whereas at the same point, they open interesting future work directions.\"\n",

Therefore, in this paper we characterized three of these drifts by describing them with a template and showing practical examples.

Hence, the complexity of self-adaptive systems results also from the existence of the managing part and the interaction between the managed and the managing parts.

In this paper, we evaluate the quality of the design of self-adaptive systems (including the managed and the managing parts) as it is done in traditional software engineering. We are interested in the internal software quality of self-adaptive systems, as the existence of the managing part and its interaction with the managed part leads to a tightly coupled system. We analyze the self-adaptive systems through the detection of different issues such as architectural and code smells and the detection of design patterns. The smells provide some hints on possible design and implementation problems, and help software engineers to improve the quality of the systems. While, design patterns are usually indicators of the application of good prac- tices in the software development and allow to capture part of the design rationale. In this way, they can help software engineers to understand, reuse, and extend self-adaptive sys- tems. In this paper, we have considered the detection of 3 architectural smells, 18 code smells, and 15 design patterns in 11 self-adaptive systems written in the Java programming language. The results indicate that the 3 architectural smells, 9 out of the 18 code smells, and the 15 design patterns have been detected in all the analyzed self-adaptive systems. We also discuss the possible reasons behind the presence of these quality issues, and provide our lessons learned.\"\n",

Thus, finding a software architecture model is quite critical, and to achieve this goal, a suitable architecture style model must be used. In this regard, attempts are made to deploy the behavior of the candidate software styles as well as the stakeholders’ desired model as functions graphs, so that the desired architecture style model graphs, which meet the maximum needs of the stakeholders, are selected by comparison. Fuzzy Cubic Spline is used in the structure of the proposed algorithm, which requires turning qualitative data into quantitative data. To evaluate the proposed approach, a controlled experiment is also conducted. The proposed approach is compared with an analytic hierarchy process-based approach (AHP), TOPSIS and PTFG (Prioritizing using tensor and fuzzy graphs) in the experiment. The results analysis demonstrates that our approach needs to less time complexity and is much easier to use and highly accurate.\" \n",

    "abstract60 = \"Due to the growing complexity of software systems, there has been a dramatic increase and industry demand for tools and techniques on software refactoring in the last ten years, defined traditionally as a set of program transformations intended to improve the system design while preserving the behavior. Refactoring studies are expanded beyond code-level restructuring to be applied at different levels (architecture, model, requirements, etc.), adopted in many domains beyond the object-oriented paradigm (cloud computing, mobile, web, etc.), used in industrial settings and considered objectives beyond improving the design to include other non-functional requirements (e.g., improve performance, security, etc.). Thus, challenges to be addressed by refactoring work are, nowadays, beyond code transformation to include, but not limited to, scheduling the opportune time to carry refactoring, recommendations of specific refactoring activities, detection of refactoring opportunities, and testing the correctness of applied refactorings. Therefore, the refactoring research efforts are fragmented over several research communities, various domains, and objectives. To structure the field and existing research results, this paper provides a systematic literature review and analyzes the results of 3183 research papers on refactoring covering the last three decades to offer the most scalable and comprehensive literature review of existing refactoring research studies. Based on this survey, we created a taxonomy to classify the existing research, identified research trends, and highlighted gaps in the literature and avenues for further research.\" \n",
