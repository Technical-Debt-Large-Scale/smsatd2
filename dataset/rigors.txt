A particular highlight to SonarQube. It was defined as a set of groups of Architectural Smell detection using Arcan Tool. The authors defined a set of formulas to represent Architectural Debt Index. The authors shown a statistical analysis of the Architectural Debt Index proposed comparing with Qualitas Corpos. The authors have detailed a good research design.problem characterization: yes, bibliographic review: yes, data collection: yes, hypothesis: no, experimentation: yes, results: yes, final: good,extra:The authors cited good references and important related works about Technical Debt analysis and effort.
